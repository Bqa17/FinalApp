## Overview

### Description

SpendApp is a simple and intuitive expense tracking app designed to help you take control of your finances. Log daily expenses, set budgets, and track spending trends with ease. Whether you're managing personal finances or planning for a big purchase, SpendApp keeps your financial goals within reach.

### App Evaluation

- **Mobile:**
    - **Uniqueness**: Stands out with real-time input and calculations, notifications for budget limits, and potential integration with device sensors (e.g., OCR for receipt scanning).  
    - **Beyond Website**: Push notifications, mobile accessibility for logging expenses on the go.  

- **Story:**
    - **Compelling Story**: Strong personal finance utility; users can clearly see how it improves financial awareness. Likely to resonate with friends or peers aiming to track budgets or cut down expenses.  
    - **Audience Appeal**: Niche value for people focused on personal finance but applicable to a broad audience.  

- **Market:**
    - **Market Size**: Moderate to large; budgeting and expense-tracking apps are popular, especially among students, young professionals, and families.  
    - **Niche Value**: High value for users needing simple and intuitive tracking tools.  

- **Habit:**
    - **Frequency**: High; users could use it daily or weekly to log expenses.  
    - **Consumption vs. Creation**: Combination; users input data (expenses) and consume generated insights (graphs, budgets).  

- **Scope:**
    - **Technical Challenge**: Moderate; requires implementing local storage or database functionality (e.g., SQLite/Room).  
    - **Stripped-down Version**: A basic version with manual logging and a simple summary is feasible and still valuable.  
    - **Definition**: Well-formed and achievable with a clear roadmap for feature development.
